In this crisis | think | may be pardoned if | do not address the House at any length today, and | hope that
any of my friends and colleagues or former colleagues who are affected by the political reconstruction
will make all allowances for any lack of ceremony with which it has been necessary to act. | say to the
House as | said to Ministers who have joined this government, | have nothing to offer but blood, toil,
sweat and tears. We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many
months of struggle and suffering. You ask, what is our policy? | say it is to wage war by land, sea and air.
War with all our might and with all the strength God has given us, and to wage war against a monstrous
tyranny never surpassed in the dark and unpleasant catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You
ask, what is our aim? | can answer in one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs—victory in spite of all
terrors—victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival. Let
that be realized. No survival for the British Empire, no survival for all that the British Empire has stood
for, no survival for the urge, the impulse of the ages, that mankind shall move forward toward his goal. |
take up my task in light heart and hope. | feel sure that our cause will not be suffered to fail among
men. | feel entitled at this juncture, at this time, to claim the aid of all and to say, “Come then, let us go

forward together with our united strength.”
